            <h1>Simplified Legal Frameworks</h1>
<hr>

<p class="text">
  This section provides plain-language explanations of key immigration-related
  legal rights and processes in the United States. The goal is to help
  individuals understand common situations they may face and know where to
  seek trusted help.
</p>

<hr>
<!-- KNOW YOUR RIGHTS -->
<h2>Know Your Basic Rights in the U.S.</h2>

<ul class="text">
  <li>You have the right to remain silent when questioned by immigration or law enforcement.</li>
  <li>You have the right to refuse a search of your home unless officers have a valid warrant signed by a judge.</li>
  <li>You have the right to speak with an attorney before signing any documents.</li>
  <li>You do not have to disclose your immigration status to local police in most situations.</li>
  <li>If you are detained by immigration, you have the right to contact your consulate.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Never present false documents or provide false
  information to immigration officials.
</p>

<hr>

<!-- IF ICE COMES -->
<h2>If Immigration Officers Come to Your Door</h2>

<ol class="text">
  <li>Stay calm and do not open the door.</li>
  <li>Ask officers to show the warrant through a window or slide it under the door.</li>
  <li>Check that the warrant is signed by a judge and has your correct name and address.</li>
  <li>If there is no valid judicial warrant, you may refuse entry.</li>
  <li>Do not sign anything without speaking to a qualified attorney.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<!-- COMMON IMMIGRATION PATHWAYS -->
<h2>Common Immigration Relief Pathways</h2>

<p class="text">
  Some immigrants in the United States may qualify for forms of humanitarian or
  family-based relief depending on their situation. Each case is different, but
  common pathways include:
</p>

<ul class="text">
  <li><strong>Family-based petitions</strong> — through qualifying U.S. citizen or permanent resident relatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Asylum</strong> — for individuals who fear persecution in their home country.</li>
  <li><strong>U Visa</strong> — for victims of certain crimes who assist law enforcement.</li>
  <li><strong>T Visa</strong> — for survivors of human trafficking.</li>
  <li><strong>Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS)</strong> — for certain undocumented minors.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">
  Eligibility requirements are complex. Always confirm with a trusted legal
  provider.
</p>

<hr>

<!-- AVOIDING NOTARIO FRAUD -->
<h2>⚠️ Avoid Immigration Scams (“Notario” Fraud)</h2>

<ul class="text">
  <li>In the U.S., a “notario” is <strong>not</strong> an immigration lawyer.</li>
  <li>Only licensed attorneys or DOJ-accredited representatives can give legal advice.</li>
  <li>Be cautious of anyone who guarantees fast results or special connections.</li>
  <li>Always request written contracts and receipts.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!-- WHEN TO SEEK HELP -->
<h2>When to Seek Legal Help</h2>

<p class="text">
  You should try to speak with a qualified immigration attorney or accredited
  representative if you:
</p>

<ul class="text">
  <li>Receive immigration court papers</li>
  <li>Are detained by immigration authorities</li>
  <li>Are considering applying for immigration benefits</li>
  <li>Have prior removal or deportation orders</li>
</ul>
