          <a href="Img/Lumiere Research Paper - Lauren Gonzalez-Perez.pdf" target="_blank">Unhomed in the Homeland: Post-Deportation Housing Insecurity and Structural Vulnerability in Guatemala</a>
          <div class="project-description">This research examines how structural vulnerabilities shape housing insecurity among Guatemalan deportees during their first year after return, using the Structural Vulnerability Theory to explore systemic barriers such as institutional neglect, social stigma, and policy gaps. Drawing on qualitative analyses, policy reviews, and empirical data from 2010–2025, the study identifies key challenges including insufficient housing, chronic social isolation, systemic fragmentation, overlapping crises, and inequities in regulations and resources. Findings show that these issues stem from structural injustices rather than individual failings, highlighting that sustainable reintegration requires long-term strategies such as statutory housing protections, inclusive community programs, and coordinated cross-border policy reforms to reduce vulnerability and support human rights.</div>

          <div class="project-description">In her research presentation "Unhomed in the Homeland," Lauren Gonzalez-Perez utilizes a qualitative systematic review to reveal that over 60% of Guatemalan deportees experience acute housing insecurity within their first year of return. While the nation faces a massive deficit of 1.8 million housing units, returnees must also navigate a fragmented reintegration system further destabilized by climate crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study underscores that these challenges are deeply gendered and ethnicized, creating feedback loops of displacement that temporary aid cannot fix. Ultimately, Gonzalez-Perez advocates for a transition toward rights-based, holistic strategies that combine stable housing with essential psychosocial and employment support to ensure successful reintegration.</div>

          <a href="Img/SPAN Policy Analyst_ California A.B. 298 - Lauren Gonzalez-Perez.pdf" target="_blank">Position Letter: California A.B. 298 – No Cost-Sharing for Patients Under 21</a>
          <div class="project-description">Lauren Gonzalez-Perez, serving as a Policy Analyst for Students for Patient Advocacy Nationwide (SPAN), authored a formal position letter in February 2026 strongly supporting California Assembly Bill 298. The bill aims to eliminate all cost-sharing—including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance—for in-network healthcare services for individuals under age 21. Gonzalez-Perez argues that removing these financial barriers is essential for improving access to preventive and behavioral health care, particularly for low-income families. To ensure the bill’s success, she recommends implementing safeguards against restrictive utilization management, maintaining consistent application across all plan types, and requiring transparent data reporting to evaluate the long-term impact on health equity and access.</div>

          <div class="project-description">As a Policy Analyst for Students for Patient Advocacy Nationwide (SPAN), Lauren Gonzalez-Perez authored a position letter in January 2026 supporting Michigan Senate Bill 107. This legislation advocates for expanded healthcare access by requiring insurers to cover pharmacist-provided immunizations, lab tests, and associated medications at in-network pharmacies. Gonzalez-Perez emphasizes that this bill is a vital tool for reaching rural and underserved communities where pharmacists are often the most accessible providers, while simultaneously relieving the burden on overstretched primary and urgent care systems. By facilitating these essential preventive services, the bill aims to improve overall public health outcomes and reduce long-term costs through early detection and proactive immunization.</div>

          <div class="project-description">Writing on behalf of Students for Patient Advocacy Nationwide (SPAN) in January 2026, Lauren Gonzalez-Perez submitted a position letter in strong support of Michigan Senate Bill 30, the Biased and Unjust Care Reporting Act. This legislation seeks to improve maternal health outcomes by requiring a validated tool for patients to report incidents of obstetric violence and perinatal mistreatment. Gonzalez-Perez advocates for specific amendments to strengthen the bill, including ensuring the tool's accessibility in multiple languages, establishing robust privacy protections, and implementing non-retaliation clauses for patients and healthcare workers. By centering the patient's voice and mandating regular public reporting of de-identified data, this bill aims to dismantle systemic racial disparities and establish Michigan as a leader in equitable, dignified maternal healthcare.</div>

          <a href="Img/PIVOT Policy Brief.pdf" target="_blank">Pursuing Justice & Equity Through Integrated Policy Action</a>
          <div class="project-description">In November 2025, Lauren Gonzalez-Perez published a comprehensive policy brief on the PIVOT website titled "Pursuing Justice & Equity Through Integrated Policy Action". Developed through the PIVOT Intensive Civil Rights Department Fellowship, this work explores the intersectional crises facing Hispanic and Latinx communities, specifically how housing instability, immigration barriers, and climate vulnerability reinforce one another. The brief provides evidence-based context on the national affordable housing shortage and the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized groups while offering coordinated recommendations for systemic reform. Gonzalez-Perez argues for a holistic, justice-driven framework that integrates housing stability, gender equity, and humane immigration systems to dismantle cycles of insecurity and promote community dignity.</div>

          <a href="Img/Civics Unplugged_ Innovators Fellowship Case Study Brief - Lauren Gonzalez-Perez (1).pdf" target="_blank">Poverty and Its Impact on Urban Communities</a>
          <div class="project-description">n Fall 2025, as a member of the Civics Unplugged Innovators Fellowship, Lauren Gonzalez-Perez authored a case study brief titled "Poverty and Its Impact on Urban Communities". Drawing on personal experience growing up in a low-income Hispanic household in Lynwood, California, the study examines how structural challenges like stagnant wages and limited affordable housing reinforce cycles of hardship. Gonzalez-Perez critiques existing welfare programs for failing to tackle the structural causes of poverty and proposes the Comprehensive Equity and Opportunity Program (CEOP)—a holistic, coordinated system that integrates universal housing guarantees, a living wage index, universal healthcare, and education reform. By addressing poverty systemically rather than superficially, the brief advocates for a community transformation that moves families from merely surviving to thriving with dignity and opportunity.</div>
